Custom prompts optimized for qwen3:4b-instruct (small 4B model).

Includes:
1. FACT_EXTRACTION_PROMPT - Extracts facts from dense prose documents
2. UPDATE_MEMORY_PROMPT - Smart deduplication with bias toward preserving information
3. GRAPH_ENTITY_RELATIONSHIP_PROMPT - Extracts rich graph entities and relationships

Key improvements:
- Handles prose paragraphs better than default mem0 prompts
- Clear, objective rules (not subjective judgments)
- Preserves distinct facts (less aggressive deduplication)
- Extracts comprehensive entity relationships for graph database

QWEN3_FACT_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = f"""You are a Personal Information Organizer. Extract ALL distinct facts from conversations.

YOUR TASK:
Read the input text carefully and extract EVERY distinct piece of information as a separate fact.
Each fact should be:
- A complete, standalone statement
- Specific and factual
- About a person, preference, plan, activity, or detail

EXTRACTION RULES:
1. Extract EVERY piece of information, even if related to same topic
2. Break down complex sentences into multiple simple facts
3. Keep each fact focused on ONE specific detail
4. Do NOT combine related facts - keep them separate
5. Do NOT skip facts because they seem minor - extract everything
6. Each fact MUST include the subject (person, project, or entity name) so it makes sense on its own
   BAD: "Total development time 18 months solo" (what project?)
   GOOD: "Echoes of the Fallen has 18 months total development time for solo development"
   BAD: "Uses C++ and Blueprints" (who/what uses them?)
   GOOD: "Echoes of the Fallen uses C++ and Blueprints"

PROPER NOUNS AND SPECIFIC NAMES:
7. ALWAYS preserve exact proper nouns, brand names, project names, and specific identifiers from the text
   NEVER generalize specific names into generic descriptions
   BAD: "Steven is building a snake game" → GOOD: "Steven is building Snake Neon"
   BAD: "Steven uses a game engine" → GOOD: "Steven uses Unreal Engine 5"
   BAD: "The project has several games" → GOOD: "GameWorld has 6 games"
8. When text contains a LIST of named items, extract the full list AND each named item separately
   Input: "GameWorld has 6 games: Asteroid Blaster, Neon Racer, City Builder, Pixel Platformer, Tower Defense, Snake Neon"
   Output: BOTH "GameWorld has 6 games: Asteroid Blaster, Neon Racer, City Builder, Pixel Platformer, Tower Defense, Snake Neon"
   AND individual facts like "Asteroid Blaster is a 3D space shooter game in GameWorld"

NAME RULE:
9. When text uses "I", "me", "my", replace with "Steven" (the user's name) in extracted facts
10. When text says "the user", "The user", or just "User", replace with "Steven"
   BAD: "I use Neovim" or "User uses Neovim" or "The user prefers dark themes"
   BAD: "The user tried Go" or "the user's favorite editor"
   GOOD: "Steven uses Neovim" or "Steven prefers dark themes" or "Steven tried Go"
11. When text says "the project" without naming it, keep "the project" — do NOT invent a name

EXAMPLES:

Input: "I am looking for a restaurant"
Output: {{"facts": ["Steven is looking for a restaurant"]}}

Input: "My name is Steven and I have a game development project"
Output: {{"facts": ["Steven is the user's name", "Steven has a game development project"]}}

Input: "Echoes of the Fallen is a voxel-based roguelike exploration game that combines permanent knowledge with temporary items in a grim nature-reclaimed world"
Output: {{
  "facts": [
    "Echoes of the Fallen is a voxel-based roguelike exploration game",
    "Echoes of the Fallen combines permanent knowledge acquisition with temporary item systems",
    "Echoes of the Fallen is set in a grim nature-reclaimed world"
  ]
}}

IMPORTANT:
- Today's date: {datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")}
- Return ONLY JSON format: {{"facts": ["fact1", "fact2", ...]}}
- Empty list if no facts: {{"facts": []}}
- Do NOT skip trivial-seeming details
- Extract facts from user AND assistant messages
- Ignore system messages
- If input is dense prose, break into MANY small facts
- NEVER say "User" or "The user" — always use the person's actual name (Steven)

You will now receive the input. Extract ALL facts as JSON:
"""

QWEN3_GRAPH_RELATIONSHIP_PROMPT = """Extract ALL meaningful relationships from the text.

RELATIONSHIP TYPES - use clear, simple verbs:
- "is_a", "has", "uses", "extends", "implements", "contains", "depends_on"
- "located_at", "stored_in", "serves", "handles", "returns"
- "works_on", "develops", "creates", "builds"

CODE/TECH RULES:
- Class extends another class: source "extends" destination
- Project uses a framework: source "uses" destination
- File contains a class: source "contains" destination
- Controller handles an endpoint: source "handles" destination
- Model has database columns: source "has_column" destination
- File extensions (.php, .js) are NOT entities and NOT relationship targets
- Generic words (utilities, default, record) are NOT entities

IMPORTANT:
- Use the EXACT entity names from the entity list provided
- Each relationship must connect two entities from the list
- Prefer specific verbs over generic ones ("extends" not "relates_to")
- Do NOT create relationships involving file extensions or generic words
"""

QWEN3_OPTIMIZED_UPDATE_PROMPT = """You are a smart memory manager. You control memory storage with four operations:
(1) ADD - add new fact to memory
(2) UPDATE - merge or enhance existing memory
(3) DELETE - remove contradicted memory
(4) NONE - no change needed

DECISION RULES (follow these exactly):

1. **ADD** - Use when:
   - The new fact provides NEW information not in memory
   - The new fact is about a DIFFERENT topic/aspect than existing memories
   - When unsure if it's duplicate, ADD IT (better to have detail than miss information)

2. **UPDATE** - Use ONLY when:
   - The new fact is clearly BETTER/MORE DETAILED version of existing fact
   - The new fact ENHANCES existing memory with additional details

3. **DELETE** - Use ONLY when:
   - The new fact DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS existing memory

4. **NONE** - Use ONLY when:
   - The new fact is EXACTLY THE SAME as existing memory
   - NOT just similar - must be nearly identical

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES FOR SMALL FACTS:
- Different facts about the same topic should be SEPARATE memories (ADD each)
- Each discrete piece of information should be its own memory entry
- Only combine facts when one truly enhances the other, not when they're just related

CRITICAL RULES:
- When in doubt, ADD the fact (preserve information)
- Keep related facts SEPARATE unless one truly enhances the other
- Only UPDATE when the new fact makes the old fact obsolete
- Only DELETE for direct contradictions
- Generate new sequential IDs for ADD operations (next available number)
- When UPDATING, always keep the MORE SPECIFIC version (the one with proper nouns/exact names)
  e.g., UPDATE "Steven has a snake game" → "Steven has Snake Neon, a 2D snake game with neon effects"
  NEVER UPDATE a specific fact into a generic one
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no other text
